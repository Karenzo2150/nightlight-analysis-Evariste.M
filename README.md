# Nightlight-analysis
The goal of this repository project is to practice Python environment setup, specifically for geospatial data analysis projects. Youâ€™ll learn to create isolated virtual environments, manage package dependencies, and integrate your work with version control using GitHub.
This exercise simulates a real-world scenario and sets up a reproducible analysis environment for spatial data processing.
This project analyzes nightlight data to understand economic activity patterns across districts and cells. This requires setting up a geospatial analysis environment and sharing your work via GitHub.
